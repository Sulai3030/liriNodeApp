# liriNodeApp
The LIRI Bot excercise is an assignment where we employed LIRI or Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and returns data. In this case it takes in parameters from both the Twitter and Spotify apis and interpolates that data and returns data to the user.
